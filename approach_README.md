## âœ… **Task Completion Summary**

Yes, the task is fully completed and functional.

---

## âœ… **Objective**

The objective is to create a **Python application (`app.py`)** that:

1. Reads a log file line-by-line.
2. Extracts valid IPv4 addresses.
3. Differentiates between private and public IPs.
4. Stores unique IPs into a **MongoDB** database under appropriate collections (`public_ips` or `private_ips`).
5. Skips duplicates (both within the file and across multiple runs using MongoDBâ€™s unique index).
6. Is **containerized** using **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for orchestration.

## âœ… **Steps Taken**

### ðŸ”§ 1. **Designing the Python Application**

* **Modular Design**: Created an `IPProcessor` class to encapsulate MongoDB logic, IP classification, and file parsing.
* **Validation**: Used the `ipaddress` module for reliable IP validation and classification (private/public).
* **Statistics**: Maintained counters to log useful stats (lines processed, IPs found, duplicates skipped).
* **MongoDB Integration**:

  * Used `pymongo`.
  * Implemented `upsert` to skip already inserted IPs.
  * Set unique indexes to ensure deduplication at DB level.

### ðŸ”§ 2. **Dockerizing the Application**

* Created a **Dockerfile**:

  * Based on `python:3.9-slim`.
  * Installed `pymongo`.
  * Set up working directory `/app`, and user isolation via `appuser`.
  * Mounted logs folder and ran `app.py` as the entry point.

### ðŸ”§ 3. **Orchestrating with Docker Compose**

* Defined two services:

  * `mongodb`: Runs MongoDB with environment variables for root user and DB.
  * `log_processor`: Python app that waits until MongoDB is healthy.
* Healthcheck ensures that the `log_processor` waits until MongoDB is up before execution.
* Used `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`.

## âœ… **Decisions Made**

* **Regex vs. Parsing**: Used regex to identify possible IPs, then filtered using `ipaddress` for accuracy.
* **MongoDB Indexing**: Chose to enforce uniqueness using `create_index('ip', unique=True)` to avoid duplicate entries across multiple runs.
* **Separation of Concerns**: Each method in `IPProcessor` is responsible for one task, improving readability and maintainability.
* **Log file mount as Read-only**: Ensures no accidental modification of logs.

## âœ… **Challenges Encountered and Solutions**

| Challenge                                   Solution
| Ensuring reliable IP classification       - Used the `ipaddress` module instead of regex-only filtering                    
| Avoiding duplicates in MongoDB            - Created unique index on the `ip` field and used `update_one(..., upsert=True)` 
| MongoDB readiness in Docker               - Used Docker Compose `healthcheck` to ensure DB is ready before app starts      
| Logging large file processing efficiently - Added periodic progress logs after every 1000 lines

## âœ… **Testing & Verification**

* Tested with log files containing:

  * Valid and invalid IPs.
  * Repeated entries.
  * Mix of public and private IPs.

* Verified:

  * Correct classification.
  * No duplication in MongoDB.
  * Statistics printed correctly.
  * Dockerized services interact as expected.
